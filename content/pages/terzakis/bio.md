# Evidence-based psychology and a pinch of real-life savvy

I am a freelance Health Psychologist specialised in designing and executing patient-centered health communication campaigns and research. Based in Erlangen, Germany, my clients are international service providers in the the healthcare world. I conduct work in German, English and Spanish.

## Hands-on experience

Before I became a freelancer in 2014, I was the Lead Health Psychology Specialist at Atlantis Healthcare Germany, a startup company in the realm of health communication and patient adherence. My time at Atlantis was a jam-packed learning curve about how to apply Health Psychology outside of academia, particularly in Germany. With an all-hands on deck attitude, I quickly became main responsible campaign strategist, content supervisor and editor-in-chief of all client-facing communication for Germany and Central Europe. I served clients among the Top 20 pharmaceutical companies worldwide and helped Atlantis Healthcare Germany expand from 5 to over 20 employees within three years. My list of current and past project sponsors includes:

- Alexion
- Celesio
- GEHE
- Genzyme (Sanofi-Aventis)
- ​GlaxoSmithKline
- Hoffmann-LaRoche
- National Health Service, UK (NHS)​
- Novartis
- Nutricia (Danone)
- Takeda
- Triumph over Phobia (TOP UK)
- University of Bath, UK
- Vifor

## A unique skillset

Not very long ago, Health Pychology was an expert area so rare in Germany that there were no German university graduates who had explicitly specialised in it. I received my Masters of Science in Health Psychology from the University of Bath, one of the highest ranking institutions in the UK. Being both a specialist in Health Psychology and a German native speaker, I was uniquely placed to follow the call for a German Health Psychologist - and so, after six years of living in the UK, I moved back to my home country to become a pioneer in appyling Health Psychology in a non-academic setting in Germany.

Theses are some indications I have come to understand more intricately through my work:

- Alzheimer's Dementia
- Asthma & COPD
- Atypical Uraemic Haemolytic Syndrome
- Cancer (e.g. renal cell carcinoma)
- Gastrointestinal dysfunction
- Myelofibrosis
- Phobias & OCD
Pregnancy in risk populations (mental health issues, - diabetes)
- ​Pulmonary hypertension
- Multiple Sclerosis
- Stroke (prevention and rehab)
- Traumatic Brain Injury

## Communication is key

All my current and past roles, including my work as a guest lecturer at the University of Bath, one-to-one with patients, and as a volunteer in the charity sector, have one common denominator: The need for skillfully conceptualised and expertly delivered health communication.

## Real service attitude

My outlook on my work is this: before anything else, it has to serve the patient. I firmly believe that the sincere wish to be of service is the foundation for good work and - as a result - commercial success. Understanding an illness, coping with and adjusting to a diagnosis, communicating well with physicians, being able to make informed decisions, making necessary lifestyle changes and taking the chosen and prescribed therapy regularly and correctly - these are not achievements any pharmaceutical or medicine product alone can yield, whatever its efficacy and safety profile. Where the patient's interests come first, when great products are matched with a great service, delivered the right way, success follows closely.
