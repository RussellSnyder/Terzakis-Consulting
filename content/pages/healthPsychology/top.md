# What is Health Psychology?

Psychologists seek to understand and predict the way we think and behave, and can help us change our thoughts, emotions and behaviour for the better. Health Psychologists are specialised in understanding and changing behaviour in the realm of physical health (in contrast to clincal psychologists, who mainly work on mental illness). The remit of Health Psychology spans from helping to maintain good health to managing acute and chronic illness, and it encompasses topics like medicine adherence, doctor-patient-communication, and coping with difficult diseases.

> It offers ways of changing things that are notoriously hard to change:
> 
> thoughts, feelings, and actions that keep us from enjoying our best possible health.
